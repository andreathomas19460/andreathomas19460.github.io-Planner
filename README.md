# Work Day Planner

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a planner
The quiz is designed to take input from user and save to local storage.
The user can type into the text areas in each deisgnated time row. 
This page is formatted to be responsive to multiple viewports. 

## Components

The webpage is comprised of:

1. Time blocks indicating the past, present, or future hour via designated color
2. Text areas for user schedule input 
3. Save buttons to commit the input and time to local storage

## Deployment

Webpage can be found at this link: https://andreathomas19460.github.io/andreathomas19460.github.io-Planner/

1. User finds planner readily available upon navigation to site
2. Via Moment.js, the user sees the current date displayed in the Jumbotron 
3. The present hour is highlighted in orange; hours before and after the "present" (or current) row are colored differently
4. The user can type their activities/reminders into the text area
5. Clicking the save button commits the user input to local storage

## Note 

 The jQuery code is committing input (text and time) to local storage when save button is clicked, but it is not displaying it when page is reloaded.
